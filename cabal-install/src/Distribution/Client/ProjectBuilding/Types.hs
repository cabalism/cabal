-- Pre-build status: result of the dry run
--

-- | The 'BuildStatus' of every package in the 'ElaboratedInstallPlan'.
--
-- This is used as the result of the dry-run of building an install plan.
type BuildStatusMap = Map UnitId BuildStatus

-- | The build status for an individual package is the state that the
-- package is in /prior/ to initiating a (re)build.
--
-- This should not be confused with a 'BuildResult' which is the result
-- /after/ successfully building a package.
--
-- It serves two purposes:
--
--  * For dry-run output, it lets us explain to the user if and why a package
--    is going to be (re)built.
--
--  * It tell us what step to start or resume building from, and carries
--    enough information for us to be able to do so.
data BuildStatus
  = -- | The package is in the 'InstallPlan.PreExisting' state, so does not
    --   need building.
    BuildStatusPreExisting
  | -- | The package is in the 'InstallPlan.Installed' state, so does not
    --   need building.
    BuildStatusInstalled
  | -- | The package has not been downloaded yet, so it will have to be
    --   downloaded, unpacked and built.
    BuildStatusDownload
  | -- | The package has not been unpacked yet, so it will have to be
    --   unpacked and built.
    BuildStatusUnpack FilePath
  | -- | The package exists in a local dir already, and just needs building
    --   or rebuilding. So this can only happen for 'BuildInplaceOnly' style
    --   packages.
    BuildStatusRebuild FilePath BuildStatusRebuild
  | -- | The package exists in a local dir already, and is fully up to date.
    --   So this package can be put into the 'InstallPlan.Installed' state
    --   and it does not need to be built.

    -- some other change resets it).
