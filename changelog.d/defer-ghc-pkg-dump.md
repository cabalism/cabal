Executing a build plan started with a bulk `ghc-pkg dump` of every package db
the plan touches, including the store, before any package was built. Most
runs never used the result: a `cabal repl` of an already configured component,
or a `cabal build` after editing a source file, configure nothing. The index is
now read the first time a package is configured, so those runs skip the dumps.
