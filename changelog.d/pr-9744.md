Adds a `cabal target` command that is useful for discovering targets in a
project for use with other commands taking ``[TARGETS]``.

Any target form except for a script target can be used with ``cabal target``.

This command, like many others, takes ``[TARGETS]``. Taken together, these will
select for a set of targets in the project. When none are supplied, the command
acts as if ``all`` was supplied. Targets in the returned subset are shown sorted
and fully-qualified with package, component type and component name such as
`Cabal-tests:test:hackage-tests`.
