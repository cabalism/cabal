synopsis: Show provenance of project constraints
description:
  When the solver rejects a package version show the provenance of the
  "requires" version constraint as a path in the project configuration import
  tree.

  ```
  $ cabal build all --dry-run
  ...
  [__1] next goal: hashable
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.3.0
        (cabal.project requires ==1.4.2.0)
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.2.0
        (https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2023-12-07/cabal.config requires ==1.4.3.0)
          imported by: cabal.project
  ```

  Fixes some test failures detecting cycles in imports, when;
  
  - the wrong import was reported as starting the cycle
  - a cycle was reported that wasn't actually a cycle

  Duplicate imports are now reported as errors, rather than silently ignored.
