synopsis: Show provenance of project constraints
description:
  When the solver rejects a package version show the provenance of the
  "requires" version constraint as a path in the project configuration import
  tree.

  ```
  $ cabal build all --dry-run
  ...
  [__1] next goal: hashable
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.3.0
        (cabal.project requires ==1.4.2.0)
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.2.0
        (https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2023-12-07/cabal.config requires ==1.4.3.0)
          imported by: cabal.project
  ```

  Even though imports are relative to their parent when imported, their paths
  are shown relative to the directory of the project in the solver output.

  ```
  $ cat oops/oops-1.config 
  import: ../oops-2.config 

  $ cabal build all --dry-run
  Resolving dependencies...
  Error: [Cabal-7107]
  Could not resolve dependencies:
  [__0] trying: oops-0.1 (user goal)
  [__1] next goal: hashable (dependency of oops)
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.3.0
        (oops/oops-9.config requires ==1.4.2.0)
          imported by: oops-8.config
          imported by: oops/oops-7.config
          imported by: oops-6.config
          imported by: oops/oops-5.config
          imported by: oops-4.config
          imported by: oops/oops-3.config
          imported by: oops-2.config
          imported by: oops/oops-1.config
          imported by: oops-0.project
  [__1] rejecting: hashable-1.4.2.0
        (oops-0.project requires ==1.4.3.0)
  [__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: hashable, oops)
  After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
  goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: hashable (3), oops (2)
  ```

  Fixes some test failures detecting cycles in imports, when;
  
  - the wrong import was reported as starting the cycle
  - a cycle was reported that wasn't actually a cycle

  Duplicate imports are now reported as warnings, rather than silently ignored.
